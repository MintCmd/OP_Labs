Mathematicians focus on four primary areas of study: quantities, structure, space, and change. 
The study of quantities involves numbers, including natural numbers and integers, and the operations that can be applied to them, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Number Theory provides a deeper understanding of these concepts. 
The study of structure began with Pythagoras, who is famous for his theorem about right-angled triangles, which laid the foundation for algebra.
